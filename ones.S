			;		ARM Programming Assignment #4: Count the ones in a binary number
			;
			;		Write a program that counts the number of ones in a binary number,
			;		stored in a word (4 bytes). Its loop should run no more times than there
			;		are ones in the number. Write the count in `numones`. For the example
			;		number given below, the loop should only run 8 times, counting 8 ones.
			;
			;		Hint:
			;		The first significant instruction in the loop is SUB r1, r1, 1, which
			;		decrements the number, assuming it's stored in register r1. Now,
			;		remember your logical operations.
			;
			;		Bonus:
			;		1. (20 extra points) For the shortest program (by instruction count),
			;		because this operation has to be FAST.
			;		2. (30 extra points) For extending the program to counting the ones
			;		in any word-aligned continuous region of memory.
